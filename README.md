# Stackoverflow Challenge #8: Word ladder

This is my submission to Stackoverflow challenge #8: Word ladder

https://stackoverflow.com/beta/challenges/79768869/code-challenge-8-word-ladder

A word ladder is a sequence of words where each word differs from the previous one by exactly one letter, and all words must be valid dictionary words.

The valid words are in the file ``sgb-words.txt``

It was not specified if the letters can be shuffled or not. My solution implement both approach.


# Execution
The code is done using Python 3.13.7. To execute, simply run ``main.py``. ``numpy`` and ``tqdm`` librairies are used.
